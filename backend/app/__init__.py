"""
This is an empty file that marks the 'app' folder as a Python package/module.
No code is needed here in most cases — it's just required by Python.

You can leave this file completely empty, or add optional comments/docs like this.

# Optional: You can import things here if you want to make them available
# when someone does "from app import something" from outside the folder.
# For now, it's not needed in this simple project.

# Example (uncomment if you ever need it):
# from .main import app
# from .database import engine, Base
